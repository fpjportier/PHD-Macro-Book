# Chapter 8

This folder includes codes to accompany Chapter 8 "Empirical strategies and quantitative macroeconomics" of the book [Macroeconomics](https://phdmacrobook.org/), by Marina Azzimonti, Per Krusell, Alisdair McKay, and Toshihiko Mukoyama, plus contributing authors (Oxford University Press, 2026).

## How to run this
Run the scripts from this directory with `julia main_figure_3.jl` or `julia main_figure_4.jl`.

Required Julia packages are `Plots`, `MatrixEquations`, `Parameters`, and `ForwardDiff`, in addition to the standard libraries.

## Figure 3: Local projections versus VARs

`main_figure_3.jl` compares impulse responses estimated by local projections (LP) and a vector autoregression (VAR) in a Monte Carlo experiment. The data come from a two-variable VAR with two lags, while both estimators use only one lag.

The experiment uses 1,000 simulated samples of 300 observations and estimates the response of the second variable to a unit innovation in the first over horizons 0–20. The VAR identifies this innovation using a Cholesky decomposition with the first variable ordered first.

The script computes a population benchmark from the model's stationary covariance matrix and propagates the response using the true dynamics. It then compares the estimates with this benchmark to illustrate the effects of using too few lags.

The output, `results/figure3_lp_vs_var_simulation.pdf`, shows median estimated responses and bands spanning the 5th–95th percentiles across simulations, alongside the benchmark. The lower panels show deviations from the benchmark.

The script also prints each method's mean squared error, averaged across simulations and horizons. Simulation and estimation helpers are in `figure_3_helpers/lpvar_share.jl`.

## Figure 4: Model of fiscal multiplier

As described on page 234, an equilibrium is a solution for $k_t$, $c_t$, $y_t$, $\ell_t$, $G_t$, $r_t$, $w_t$, $A_t$, and $\eta_t$ that satisfies

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t &= A_t k_{t-1}^{\alpha}\ell_t^{1-\alpha} \\
y_t &= c_t + k_t - (1-\delta)k_{t-1} + G_t \\
A_t &= (1-\rho_A) + \rho_A A_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{A,t} \\
\eta_t &= (1-\rho_\eta) + \rho_\eta \eta_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{\eta,t} \\
\frac{1}{c_t} &= \beta(1+r_{t+1}-\delta)\frac{1}{c_{t+1}} \\
\frac{w_t}{c_t} &= \ell_t^\psi \\
r_t &= \alpha\frac{y_t}{k_{t-1}} \\
w_t &= (1-\alpha)\frac{y_t}{\ell_t} \\
\frac{\gamma\eta_t}{G_t} &= \frac{1}{c_t}
\end{aligned}
$$

We have changed the timing on capital so that $k_t$ is chosen at date $t$. We have also dropped the expectation operator.

We linearize the model equations and solve for a perfect-foresight transition path in response to a fiscal-policy shock. Solutions of linearized models feature certainty equivalence, so decisions are taken as if future variables were known to equal their expected values. To a first-order approximation, the perfect-foresight transition path therefore coincides with the solution under uncertainty.

### Steady state

Using variables without time subscripts to denote steady-state values, the steady state satisfies

$$
\begin{aligned}
A &= 1 \\
\eta &= 1 \\
G &= \gamma\eta c \\
y &= k^\alpha \ell^{1-\alpha} \\
y &= c + \delta k + G \\
r &= \beta^{-1} - 1 + \delta \\
\frac{w}{c} &= \ell^\psi \\
r &= \alpha\frac{y}{k} \\
w &= (1-\alpha)\frac{y}{\ell}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can solve this system in a series of steps:

$$
r = \beta^{-1} - 1 + \delta
$$

$$
\frac{y}{k} = \alpha^{-1} r
$$

$$
\frac{k}{\ell}=\left(\frac{y}{k}\right)^{1/(\alpha-1)}
$$

$$
\frac{c}{\ell}
=(1+\gamma\eta)^{-1}
\left[
\frac{y}{k}\frac{k}{\ell}-
\delta\frac{k}{\ell}
\right]
$$

$$
\ell=
\left[
(1-\alpha)
\frac{y}{k}
\frac{k}{\ell}
\bigg/
\left(\frac{c}{\ell}\right)
\right]^{1/(1+\psi)}
$$

$$
c=
\frac{c}{\ell}\ell
$$

$$
k=
\frac{k}{\ell}\ell
$$

$$
\vdots
$$

### Dynamics and linearization

For the transition dynamics, we solve for dates $0,\ldots,T-1$, taking initial lagged values and terminal leads at date $T$ to be at steady state. This approximates a transition that eventually returns to steady state.

The procedure presumes a stable equilibrium of the kind discussed through the Blanchard-Kahn conditions in Chapter 10. The code does not separately check those conditions. Increasing $T$ provides a check on whether the terminal approximation affects the responses of interest.

We stack the variables in a $9T\times 1$ vector $X$: first all $T$ dates of $k$, then $c$, $y$, $\ell$, $G$, $r$, $w$, $A$, and $\eta$.

The equilibrium conditions are

$$
F(X,E)=0,
$$

where $F$ stacks each equation's residuals over all dates and $E$ contains the two sequences of innovations.

Let $X_{ss}$ denote the stacked steady state. Linearizing around $(X_{ss},0)$ gives

$$
F_X \Delta X + F_E E = 0,
\qquad
\Delta X = X-X_{ss},
$$

so that

$$
\Delta X \approx -F_X^{-1}F_EE,
\qquad
X_{\mathrm{lin}} = X_{ss}+\Delta X.
$$

The Jacobians are evaluated at steady state. The code solves the corresponding linear system for `dX` rather than explicitly forming the inverse, and stores the response levels in `Xlin`.

### Fiscal-policy impulse response

The default impulse response sets

$$
\varepsilon_{\eta,0}=1
$$

and all other innovations to zero. This unit innovation normalizes the first-order response.

The cumulative fiscal multiplier over $H$ quarters is

$$
\frac{\sum_{t=0}^{H-1}\Delta y_t}
{\sum_{t=0}^{H-1}\Delta G_t},
$$

with $H=12$ by default and no discounting.

The calculations are performed in `main_figure_4.jl` and use utilities in `figure_4_helpers/ModelUtils.jl`, from [ModelUtils.jl](https://github.com/amckay/ModelUtils.jl).
